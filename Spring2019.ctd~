Implementation
• the task of an algorithm
   ◇ described in a standard programming language
      ▪ no library functions

• Example: return in y the integer square root of x
   ◇ naive algorithm takes time proportional to y
   ◇ but exists algorithm based on binary search that takes time proportional to the logarithm of y


Sorting
• commonly-analyzed algorithm category
• has specification:
   ◇ PRE: Array A[1..n] of numbers
      ▪ or something with a total order
   ◇ POST: A[1..n] is non-decreasing
      ▪ ∀i ∀j (1 &lt;= i &lt;= j &lt;= n ⇒ A[i] &lt;= A[j])
      ▪ ∀i (1 &lt;= i &lt;= n-1) ⇒ A[i] &lt;= A[i+1]

      ▪ if extra assumptions
   ◇ some run in time proportional to n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>

Selection
• specifications
   ◇ PRE: Array a[1..n] of numbers, k with k ∈ 1...n
   ◇ POST: return the kth smallest element of A
• Q: may A be modified?
   ◇ A1: No (default for specification)
   ◇ A2: yes, but only by permutation
• Q: what does “x is kth smallest” mean?
   ◇ there are (k-1) elements that are smaller than x


Top-Down Approach to Algorithms
• Reduction principle
   ◇ solve a problem by using a solution to a simpler problem
      ▪ break it down
• Simple top-down sorting
   ◇ may sort array A[1..n] as follows:
      ▪ if n &lt;= 1, then A[1..n] is already sorted


Recursive Insertion Sort
• PRE: A[1..n] is an array of numbers
• POST: A[1..n] is a permutation of its original values such that A[1..n] is non-decreasing
• </rich_text>
			<rich_text justification="left"></rich_text>
			<rich_text>
• Notation for passing arrays as parameters:
   ◇ pointer to the array is passed
   ◇ boundaries are specified
• Need to specify InsertLast()
   ◇ PRE: A[1..n] with n &gt;= 1 is array of numbers such that A[1..n-1] is non-decreasing
   ◇ POST: A[1..n] is permutation of its original value s.t. A[1..n] is non-decreasing
• Space Usage
   ◇ when running, the stack grows to size at least proportional to n
   ◇ can limit performance as stack space is often limited


Bottom-up computation
• can save stack space by implementing a top-down design in bottom-up fashion
   1) compute solutions to smallest instance
   2) using top-down solution as guide, combine solutions of smaller instances to obtain solutions to larger instances
• fibonacci function

			<rich_text>Correctness Proofs
• people do not fully understand an algorithm until they are able to prove its correctness
• therefore, we shall
   ◇ design algorithms with correctness in mind

Correctness of Iterative Algorithms
• given loop invariant, must prove
   ◇ Initialization: invariant holds before first iteration
   ◇ maintenance: if invariant holds at beginning of an iteration, must also hold at end
   ◇ termination: the loop always exits
   ◇ correctness: loop invariant, together w/ exit condition, implies desired correctness property


Iterative InsertionSort
• still rely on InsertLast
• Specification:
   ◇ PRE: A[1..n]
   ◇ POST: A[1..n] s.t. it is non-decreasing
• Loop invariant: A[1..n] is a permutation of original values s.t. A[1..i-1] is non-decreasing

InsertionSort, Inner Loop
• Spec:
   ◇ PRE: A[1..n] is an array of numbers and i with 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n s.t. A[1..i-1] is non-decreasing
   ◇ POST: A[1..n] is permutation of original values s.t. A[1..i] is non-decreasing

• Tentative invariant:
   ◇ A[1..n] is permutation of original values
   ◇ A[1..j-1] and A[j..i] are both non-decreasing
• invariant does hold, and can show
   ◇ initialization

• new invariant:
   ◇ A[1..n] is a permutation of its original values s.t. for all 1 &lt;= k &lt; k' &lt;= i, if k' != j then A[k] &lt;= A[k']


Correctness of Recursive Algorithms
• Want to prove correctness of recursive function
   ◇ called with arg of “size” n
• need to analyze the body
   ◇ to keep analysis manageable must be able to assume that each subcall gives correct result
   ◇ let i be the “size” of the arg to subcall
   ◇ then expect that i &lt; n
• can tgys aooeak ti mathematical induction

Recursive FindLast
• spec
   ◇ PRE: x ∈ A[1..n] (thus n &gt;= 1)
   ◇ POST: returns p ∈ 1..n: A[p] = x ∉ A[p + 1..n]

What do we mean by Running Time?
• algorithm has running time f(n) may mean that
   ◇ for all inputs of “size” n, it takes at most f(n)
      ▪ thus f is upper bound
   ◇ for all inputs, it takes at least f(n)
      ▪ thus f is lower bound
   ◇ there exists some input of size n on which it takes time at least f(n)
      ▪ thus cannot get better upper bound than f(n)
   ◇ considering all inputs of size n, average time is f(n)
      ▪ requires probability distribution

Succinct Representation
• often calculate running time by some complex equation
   ◇ e.g. 4n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> + 7n + 8
• in the long run, what matters is the quadratic factor
   ◇ other parts of the equation rarely have a meaningful contribution in large sets
   ◇ will suffice to write O(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>) or Θ(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)
• in the following we will only consider functions
   ◇ from natural numbers (# of bits in input)
   ◇ to non-negative real numbers (running time in ms, space use in MB, etc)
• our choices of unit do not matter

Big-O Notation
• definition:
   ◇ f ∈ O(g) iff exists c &gt; 0 and n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> &gt;= 0 s.t. for all n with n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, f(n) &lt;= cg(n)
   ◇ note: f is a function, O(g) is a </rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">set</rich_text>
			<rich_text> of functions
      ▪ is common abuse of notation to say f = O(g)
• interpretation:
   ◇ algorithm has running time in O(g) iff exists f ∈ O(g) s.t. for all n, and all input of size n, running time is at most f(n)
• threshold rule: in above definition, may omit the part concerning n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> (assuming g is strictly positive)

Properties of O-relation
• relation “f ∈ O(g)” is
   ◇ reflexive: f ∈ O(f)
   ◇ transitive: if f ∈ O(g) and g ∈ O(h) then f ∈ O(h)

Limit Property
• A sufficient condition for f ∈ O(g) is that there exists c with 0 &lt;= c &lt; infinity s.t. lim(n-&gt;inf) { f(n)/g(n) } = c
• Ex: O(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>) = O(4n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> + 7n + 9)
• a limit is not a necessary condition
   ◇ f(n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">[lg n]</rich_text>
			<rich_text>; g(n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">lg n</rich_text>
			<rich_text>

Big-Omega Notation
• dual to Big-O
   ◇ f ∈ Ω(g) iff g ∈ O(f)
• That is, f ∈ Ω(g) iff exists c &gt; 0 and n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. for all n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, g(n) &lt;= cf(n)

Interpretation of Ω Relation
• What does it mean that alg has running time in Ω(g)?
   ◇ all - there exists f ∈ Ω(g) s.t. for all n, and all input of size n, running time is at least f(n)
   ◇ some - exists f ∈ Ω(g) s.t. for all n there is some input (worst case) of size n s.t. running time is at least f(n)
• Is Insertion sort in Ω(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)?
   ◇ according to some (worst case), Yes
   ◇ according to all, No
• Insertion sort is always in Ω(n)


Big-Theta
• say that f ∈ Θ iff f ∈ O(g) and f ∈ Ω(g)
• That is, exists c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">1</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. (from a certain point) f(n) is “sandwiched” between c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">1</rich_text>
			<rich_text>g(n) and c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>g(n)

Standard Usage
• will typically consider worst-case running time
• thus, Insertion sort is
   ◇ in Θ(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)
   ◇ in Ω(g)


Little-o, Little-omega
• Little-o: we say f ∈ o(g) iff for all real c &gt; 0 exists n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. for all n with n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, f(n) &lt; cg(n)
• Equivalently: f  ∈  o(g) iff
   ◇ lim(n-&gt;inf) { f(n) / g(n) } = 0
• says that f grows slower than g
• Little-omega: we say f ∈ ω(g) iff g ∈ o(f)

Outline
• will develop techniques for analyzing the running time of a program built w/ loops, conditionals, and assignments
   ◇ postponing recursion
   ◇ assume assignments take constant time
• agenda:
   ◇ motivate and state a general theorem that is widely applicable to (nested) loops


Analyze Loops by Estimating Sums
• running time of an iterative construct can be expressed as sum of the form sum(i=1 -&gt; g(n)) { f(i) }
   ◇ g(n) can be something like n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
   ◇ f(i) is the function explicitly within the loop


Upper Estimates
• It is easy to see that T</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>(n) ∈ O(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">8</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)


Lower Estimates
• Upper asymptotic bounds are often also lower bounds
• Pitfall
   ◇ recall conjecture: sum(i=1 -&gt; g(n)) { f(i) ∈ Θ(g(n) * f(g(n))) }
   ◇ with g(n) = n and f(i) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">i</rich_text>
			<rich_text>


Smooth Functions
• a non-decreasing function f is smooth if there exists c and n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. for all n (with n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>):
   ◇ f(2n) &lt;= cf(n)
   ◇ f(n) = n is smooth
   ◇ being smooth is closed under various operations, like addition and multiplication
• thus all polynomials are smooth (if positive coefficients)
   ◇ f(n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">n</rich_text>
			<rich_text> is </rich_text>
			<rich_text underline="single">not</rich_text>
			<rich_text> smooth since f(2n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2n</rich_text>
			<rich_text> = (2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">n</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> = f(n)</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>


Key Result
• let X be O, Θ, or Ω.  Assume that T(n) = sum(i=1 -&gt; g(n)) { h(i) }
   ◇ where h ∈ X(f)
• can write T(n) ∈ sum(i=1 -&gt; g(n)) { X(f(i)) }
• if f is smooth (non-decreasing) then
   ◇ T(n) ∈ X(g(n) * f(g(n)))
• to apply, may need to rename so loop starts at 1


What is an Elementary Instruction
• recall iterative fibonacci function
   ◇ may naively think it runs in linear time
   ◇ in k'th iteration add Θ(k)-bit numbers so running time is rather Θ(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)
• for most programs can safely assume that assignments execute in constant time


Barometer Instructions
• executed that gets executed at least as often as any other instruction
   ◇ can be used to estimate total running time
   ◇ estimate number of times barometer instruction is executed</rich_text>

Divide and Conquer Paradigm

   ◇ POST: A[1..n] is sorted permutation of initial values
• </rich_text>
			<rich_text justification="left"></rich_text>

• Merge:

			<rich_text>, A</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">2</rich_text>

			<rich_text>])
   ◇ running time: Θ(n) w.r.t. time and space
      ▪ MergeSort is not “in-place”
         - doesn't take constant space
   ◇ time recurrence
      ▪ T(n) ∈ 2T(n/2) + Θ(n)
      ▪ Solution: T(n) ∈ Θ(n lg n)
   ◇ space recurrence
      ▪ space can be reused
      ▪ S(n) ∈ S(n/2) + Θ(n)


Substitution Method
• address how to solve a recurrence such as T(n) &lt;= aT(n/b) + f(n)
