			<rich_text>Previous historical records
• very biased
• ignore existence of native populations
• keep in mind who they're written by - the Europeans who landed here

Flora/Fauna
• pre-human North America had great species diversity
• climate is more like the sahara or serengeti
• many large/giant animal species
• horses were originally native to NA, but died off

First Humans in NA
• 35,000 - 50,000 years ago
• likely that some people arrived by boat before the Bering land bridge
• land bridge around 35k years ago
• around 10k years ago, domesticated crops created
   ◇ beans, squash, gourds first
   ◇ cotton, corn, pottery around 5k years ago
   ◇ early diets were heavy in corn, causing Niacin deficiencies
      ▪ natives didn't know what they were missing, but fixed with lime from stone

Olmecs
• “mother culture”
   ◇ 1900-1500 BCE
• create first cities
   ◇ leads to social heirarchies, leisure classes, art, etc.
   ◇ more specialization in roles
• created religious sites
   ◇ had distinct priest class

Mayans
• 750 BC
   ◇ last city conquered by the Spanish in 1697 CE
• first known heiroglyphic writing
   ◇ used to write codices with history and info about daily life
   ◇ many writings burned by the Spanish
• Came up with concept of 0
   ◇ incredibly important mathematical concept
   ◇ allows for large-scale math
• used calendar called Tzolkin

Aztecs
• 1325-1521 CE
• capital city called Tenochititlan
   ◇ rivals almost every Roman city built, but in less than 200 years
   ◇ used arches and aqueducts
• built floating terraces to grow food
• had several enemies
   ◇ large empires are rarely built entirely on peace

Inca
• 1438-1525 CE
• largest empire in pre-Colombian America
• built empire in mountains
   ◇ creates new challenges for agriculture and travel
   ◇ developed extensive roads and mountain farming systems
      ▪ over 12,000 miles of roads
• most artwork destroyed by Spanish

Continental US Natives
• Cahokia, IL - mound builders
   ◇ generic term
   ◇ culture lacked writing, hard to learn from
   ◇ may have been one group or multiple groups
• Mesa Verde, CO - Anasazi
   ◇ built houses into the sides of rock mesas</rich_text>

Implementation
• the task of an algorithm
   ◇ described in a standard programming language
      ▪ no library functions
   ◇ uses osme time and space, which should be minimized
• Example: return in y the integer square root of x
   ◇ naive algorithm takes time proportional to y
   ◇ but exists algorithm based on binary search that takes time proportional to the logarithm of y


Sorting
• commonly-analyzed algorithm category
• has specification:
   ◇ PRE: Array A[1..n] of numbers
      ▪ or something with a total order
   ◇ POST: A[1..n] is non-decreasing</rich_text>
