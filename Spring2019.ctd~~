         - has economic and military reasons not to
      ▪ Bacon gathers lower class members, creates list of demands

Implementation
• the task of an algorithm
   ◇ described in a standard programming language
      ▪ no library functions

• Example: return in y the integer square root of x
   ◇ naive algorithm takes time proportional to y
   ◇ but exists algorithm based on binary search that takes time proportional to the logarithm of y


Sorting
• commonly-analyzed algorithm category
• has specification:

   ◇ POST: A[1..n] is non-decreasing

      ▪ if extra assumptions
   ◇ some run in time proportional to n</rich_text>

			<rich_text>

Selection
• specifications
   ◇ PRE: Array a[1..n] of numbers, k with k ∈ 1...n
   ◇ POST: return the kth smallest element of A
• Q: may A be modified?
   ◇ A1: No (default for specification)
   ◇ A2: yes, but only by permutation
• Q: what does “x is kth smallest” mean?
   ◇ there are (k-1) elements that are smaller than x


Top-Down Approach to Algorithms
• Reduction principle
   ◇ solve a problem by using a solution to a simpler problem
      ▪ break it down
• Simple top-down sorting
   ◇ may sort array A[1..n] as follows:
      ▪ if n &lt;= 1, then A[1..n] is already sorted


Recursive Insertion Sort

• POST: A[1..n] is a permutation of its original values such that A[1..n] is non-decreasing
• </rich_text>
			<rich_text justification="left"></rich_text>
			<rich_text>
• Notation for passing arrays as parameters:
   ◇ pointer to the array is passed
   ◇ boundaries are specified
• Need to specify InsertLast()
   ◇ PRE: A[1..n] with n &gt;= 1 is array of numbers such that A[1..n-1] is non-decreasing
   ◇ POST: A[1..n] is permutation of its original value s.t. A[1..n] is non-decreasing
• Space Usage
   ◇ when running, the stack grows to size at least proportional to n
   ◇ can limit performance as stack space is often limited


Bottom-up computation
• can save stack space by implementing a top-down design in bottom-up fashion
   1) compute solutions to smallest instance
   2) using top-down solution as guide, combine solutions of smaller instances to obtain solutions to larger instances
• fibonacci function

Correctness of Recursive Algorithms
• Want to prove correctness of recursive function
   ◇ called with arg of “size” n
• need to analyze the body
   ◇ to keep analysis manageable must be able to assume that each subcall gives correct result
   ◇ let i be the “size” of the arg to subcall
   ◇ then expect that i &lt; n
• can tgys aooeak ti mathematical induction

Recursive FindLast

   ◇ POST: returns p ∈ 1..n: A[p] = x ∉ A[p + 1..n]

What do we mean by Running Time?
• algorithm has running time f(n) may mean that
   ◇ for all inputs of “size” n, it takes at most f(n)
      ▪ thus f is upper bound
   ◇ for all inputs, it takes at least f(n)
      ▪ thus f is lower bound
   ◇ there exists some input of size n on which it takes time at least f(n)
      ▪ thus cannot get better upper bound than f(n)
   ◇ considering all inputs of size n, average time is f(n)
      ▪ requires probability distribution

Succinct Representation
• often calculate running time by some complex equation
   ◇ e.g. 4n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> + 7n + 8
• in the long run, what matters is the quadratic factor
   ◇ other parts of the equation rarely have a meaningful contribution in large sets
   ◇ will suffice to write O(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>) or Θ(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)
• in the following we will only consider functions
   ◇ from natural numbers (# of bits in input)
   ◇ to non-negative real numbers (running time in ms, space use in MB, etc)
• our choices of unit do not matter

Big-O Notation
• definition:
   ◇ f ∈ O(g) iff exists c &gt; 0 and n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> &gt;= 0 s.t. for all n with n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, f(n) &lt;= cg(n)
   ◇ note: f is a function, O(g) is a </rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">set</rich_text>
			<rich_text> of functions
      ▪ is common abuse of notation to say f = O(g)
• interpretation:
   ◇ algorithm has running time in O(g) iff exists f ∈ O(g) s.t. for all n, and all input of size n, running time is at most f(n)
• threshold rule: in above definition, may omit the part concerning n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> (assuming g is strictly positive)

Properties of O-relation
• relation “f ∈ O(g)” is
   ◇ reflexive: f ∈ O(f)
   ◇ transitive: if f ∈ O(g) and g ∈ O(h) then f ∈ O(h)

Limit Property
• A sufficient condition for f ∈ O(g) is that there exists c with 0 &lt;= c &lt; infinity s.t. lim(n-&gt;inf) { f(n)/g(n) } = c
• Ex: O(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>) = O(4n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> + 7n + 9)
• a limit is not a necessary condition
   ◇ f(n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">[lg n]</rich_text>
			<rich_text>; g(n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">lg n</rich_text>
			<rich_text>

Big-Omega Notation
• dual to Big-O
   ◇ f ∈ Ω(g) iff g ∈ O(f)
• That is, f ∈ Ω(g) iff exists c &gt; 0 and n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. for all n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, g(n) &lt;= cf(n)

Interpretation of Ω Relation
• What does it mean that alg has running time in Ω(g)?
   ◇ all - there exists f ∈ Ω(g) s.t. for all n, and all input of size n, running time is at least f(n)
   ◇ some - exists f ∈ Ω(g) s.t. for all n there is some input (worst case) of size n s.t. running time is at least f(n)
• Is Insertion sort in Ω(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)?
   ◇ according to some (worst case), Yes
   ◇ according to all, No
• Insertion sort is always in Ω(n)


Big-Theta
• say that f ∈ Θ iff f ∈ O(g) and f ∈ Ω(g)
• That is, exists c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">1</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. (from a certain point) f(n) is “sandwiched” between c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">1</rich_text>
			<rich_text>g(n) and c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>g(n)

Standard Usage
• will typically consider worst-case running time
• thus, Insertion sort is
   ◇ in Θ(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)
   ◇ in Ω(g)


Little-o, Little-omega
• Little-o: we say f ∈ o(g) iff for all real c &gt; 0 exists n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. for all n with n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, f(n) &lt; cg(n)
• Equivalently: f  ∈  o(g) iff
   ◇ lim(n-&gt;inf) { f(n) / g(n) } = 0
• says that f grows slower than g
• Little-omega: we say f ∈ ω(g) iff g ∈ o(f)

      ▪ use udisks to detect new SD card?
   ◇ set up DNS and DHCP entries for each Pi
• running services
   ◇ ask if DNS/DHCP on Zeroes or Pi3
   ◇ ask if want k8s or Docker Swarm
• updates
   ◇ automated updates if desired
   ◇ simultaneous updates using tmux script
   ◇ ansible?
• job scheduling?
   ◇ check for k8s and docker capabilities
