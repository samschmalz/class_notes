Top-Down Approach to Algorithms
• Reduction principle
   ◇ solve a problem by using a solution to a simpler problem
      ▪ break it down
• Simple top-down sorting
   ◇ may sort array A[1..n] as follows:
      ▪ if n &lt;= 1, then A[1..n] is already sorted


Recursive Insertion Sort
• PRE: A[1..n] is an array of numbers
• POST: A[1..n] is a permutation of its original values such that A[1..n] is non-decreasing
• </rich_text>
			<rich_text justification="left"></rich_text>
			<rich_text>
• Notation for passing arrays as parameters:
   ◇ pointer to the array is passed
   ◇ boundaries are specified
• Need to specify InsertLast()
   ◇ PRE: A[1..n] with n &gt;= 1 is array of numbers such that A[1..n-1] is non-decreasing
   ◇ POST: A[1..n] is permutation of its original value s.t. A[1..n] is non-decreasing
• Space Usage
   ◇ when running, the stack grows to size at least proportional to n
   ◇ can limit performance as stack space is often limited


Bottom-up computation
• can save stack space by implementing a top-down design in bottom-up fashion
   1) compute solutions to smallest instance
   2) using top-down solution as guide, combine solutions of smaller instances to obtain solutions to larger instances

   ◇ “←” indicates value assignment to a value


Insertion Sort, Bottom-Up

What do we mean by Running Time?
• algorithm has running time f(n) may mean that
   ◇ for all inputs of “size” n, it takes at most f(n)
      ▪ thus f is upper bound
   ◇ for all inputs, it takes at least f(n)
      ▪ thus f is lower bound
   ◇ there exists some input of size n on which it takes time at least f(n)
      ▪ thus cannot get better upper bound than f(n)
   ◇ considering all inputs of size n, average time is f(n)
      ▪ requires probability distribution

Succinct Representation
• often calculate running time by some complex equation
   ◇ e.g. 4n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> + 7n + 8
• in the long run, what matters is the quadratic factor
   ◇ other parts of the equation rarely have a meaningful contribution in large sets
   ◇ will suffice to write O(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>) or Θ(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)
• in the following we will only consider functions
   ◇ from natural numbers (# of bits in input)
   ◇ to non-negative real numbers (running time in ms, space use in MB, etc)
• our choices of unit do not matter

Big-O Notation
• definition:
   ◇ f ∈ O(g) iff exists c &gt; 0 and n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> &gt;= 0 s.t. for all n with n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, f(n) &lt;= cg(n)
   ◇ note: f is a function, O(g) is a </rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">set</rich_text>
			<rich_text> of functions
      ▪ is common abuse of notation to say f = O(g)
• interpretation:
   ◇ algorithm has running time in O(g) iff exists f ∈ O(g) s.t. for all n, and all input of size n, running time is at most f(n)
• threshold rule: in above definition, may omit the part concerning n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> (assuming g is strictly positive)

Properties of O-relation
• relation “f ∈ O(g)” is
   ◇ reflexive: f ∈ O(f)
   ◇ transitive: if f ∈ O(g) and g ∈ O(h) then f ∈ O(h)

Limit Property
• A sufficient condition for f ∈ O(g) is that there exists c with 0 &lt;= c &lt; infinity s.t. lim(n-&gt;inf) { f(n)/g(n) } = c
• Ex: O(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>) = O(4n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> + 7n + 9)
• a limit is not a necessary condition
   ◇ f(n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">[lg n]</rich_text>
			<rich_text>; g(n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">lg n</rich_text>
			<rich_text>

Big-Omega Notation
• dual to Big-O
   ◇ f ∈ Ω(g) iff g ∈ O(f)
• That is, f ∈ Ω(g) iff exists c &gt; 0 and n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. for all n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, g(n) &lt;= cf(n)

Interpretation of Ω Relation
• What does it mean that alg has running time in Ω(g)?
   ◇ all - there exists f ∈ Ω(g) s.t. for all n, and all input of size n, running time is at least f(n)
   ◇ some - exists f ∈ Ω(g) s.t. for all n there is some input (worst case) of size n s.t. running time is at least f(n)
• Is Insertion sort in Ω(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)?
   ◇ according to some (worst case), Yes
   ◇ according to all, No
• Insertion sort is always in Ω(n)


Big-Theta
• say that f ∈ Θ iff f ∈ O(g) and f ∈ Ω(g)
• That is, exists c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">1</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. (from a certain point) f(n) is “sandwiched” between c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">1</rich_text>
			<rich_text>g(n) and c</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>g(n)

Standard Usage
• will typically consider worst-case running time
• thus, Insertion sort is
   ◇ in Θ(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)
   ◇ in Ω(g)


Little-o, Little-omega

			<rich_text> s.t. for all n with n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, f(n) &lt; cg(n)
• Equivalently: f  ∈  o(g) iff
   ◇ lim(n-&gt;inf) { f(n) / g(n) } = 0
• says that f grows slower than g
• Little-omega: we say f ∈ ω(g) iff g ∈ o(f)

Outline
• will develop techniques for analyzing the running time of a program built w/ loops, conditionals, and assignments
   ◇ postponing recursion
   ◇ assume assignments take constant time
• agenda:
   ◇ motivate and state a general theorem that is widely applicable to (nested) loops


Analyze Loops by Estimating Sums
• running time of an iterative construct can be expressed as sum of the form sum(i=1 -&gt; g(n)) { f(i) }
   ◇ g(n) can be something like n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
   ◇ f(i) is the function explicitly within the loop


Upper Estimates
• It is easy to see that T</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>(n) ∈ O(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">8</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)


Lower Estimates
• Upper asymptotic bounds are often also lower bounds
• Pitfall
   ◇ recall conjecture: sum(i=1 -&gt; g(n)) { f(i) ∈ Θ(g(n) * f(g(n))) }
   ◇ with g(n) = n and f(i) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">i</rich_text>
			<rich_text>


Smooth Functions
• a non-decreasing function f is smooth if there exists c and n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> s.t. for all n (with n &gt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text>):
   ◇ f(2n) &lt;= cf(n)
   ◇ f(n) = n is smooth
   ◇ being smooth is closed under various operations, like addition and multiplication
• thus all polynomials are smooth (if positive coefficients)
   ◇ f(n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">n</rich_text>
			<rich_text> is </rich_text>
			<rich_text underline="single">not</rich_text>
			<rich_text> smooth since f(2n) = 2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2n</rich_text>
			<rich_text> = (2</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">n</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text> = f(n)</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>


Key Result
• let X be O, Θ, or Ω.  Assume that T(n) = sum(i=1 -&gt; g(n)) { h(i) }
   ◇ where h ∈ X(f)
• can write T(n) ∈ sum(i=1 -&gt; g(n)) { X(f(i)) }
• if f is smooth (non-decreasing) then
   ◇ T(n) ∈ X(g(n) * f(g(n)))
• to apply, may need to rename so loop starts at 1


What is an Elementary Instruction
• recall iterative fibonacci function
   ◇ may naively think it runs in linear time
   ◇ in k'th iteration add Θ(k)-bit numbers so running time is rather Θ(n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>)
• for most programs can safely assume that assignments execute in constant time


Barometer Instructions
• executed that gets executed at least as often as any other instruction
   ◇ can be used to estimate total running time
   ◇ estimate number of times barometer instruction is executed</rich_text>

Dutch National Flag
• input: array of items, each having prop of red, white, or blue


Application in Selection Problem
• find the kth smallest element in A, let
   ◇ p be some element in A
   ◇ those elements smaller than p be red
   ◇ those elems == to p be white
   ◇ elems larger than p be blue
• dutch national flag finds r red elems, w white, and b blue
   ◇ if k &lt;= r, return kth smallest elem in red
   ◇ if k &gt; r+w, return k - r - wth smallest elem in blue partition


Top-down solution
• reduce instance of size n &gt; 0 to instance of size n - 1 by examining last item
   ◇ if it is blue, ignore it
   ◇ if it is blue, swap with first item and ignore it
   ◇ else:
      ▪ temporarily ignore it and solve remaining problem
      ▪ swap with first blue item, if there is one</rich_text>

Basic Concepts
• directed graph G consists of
   ◇ vertices (V), also called nodes
   ◇ edges (E) where an edge
      ▪ goes from source node
      ▪ goes to a target node (which may equal the source)
      ▪ may carry extra data (distance/weight)
• No multigraphs:
   ◇ two distinct edges cannot have same source and target
• Path (of length n) from u</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">0</rich_text>
			<rich_text> to u</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">n</rich_text>
			<rich_text> is a sequence of edges
• size of graph is measured as
   ◇ n, number of nodes (|V|)
   ◇ a, number of edges (|E|)
      ▪ 0 &lt;= a &lt;= n</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sup">2</rich_text>
			<rich_text>


Undirected graphs
• similar to directed, except
   ◇ edges do not have direction
   ◇ no self-loops
• edge is now between two different nodes
   ◇ now 0 &lt;= a &lt;= n*(n-1)


Cycles
• for directed graph, a cycle is
   ◇ path of length &gt;= 1 from a node to itself
• given directed acyclic graph (DAG), is possible to find topological sort of the nodes
   ◇ a numbering u</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">1</rich_text>
			<rich_text>, ... u</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">n</rich_text>
			<rich_text> of the nodes s.t.
   ◇ if there is an edge from u</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">i</rich_text>
			<rich_text> to u</rich_text>
			<rich_text scale="sub">j</rich_text>
			<rich_text> then i &lt; j
• for undirected graph, cycle consists of
   ◇ path between u and v, together with
   ◇ an edge between v and u that does not occur in that path


Connectivity
• for undirected graph, nodes u and v are connected if
   ◇ exists a path between u and v
• for a directed graph, nodes u and v are
   ◇ strongly connected if there exists a path from u to v </rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">and</rich_text>
			<rich_text> a path from v to u
   ◇ connected if there exists a path from u to v </rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">or</rich_text>
			<rich_text> a path from v to u
   ◇ weakly connected if u and v are connected in the corresponding undirected graph
   ◇ we say that G is (strongly) connected if al u, v ∈ G are (strongly) connected


Trees
• undirected graph is called a tree if it is
   ◇ connected
   ◇ acyclic
• often identify a non-empty tree w/ its root node
   ◇ each tree node but the root has exactly one parent
   ◇ all tree nodes have root as ancestor
   ◇ a leaf is a node where all children are empty
   ◇ in binary trees, all nodes have exactly two children


Distance Metrics in Rooted Trees
• for a rooted tree T, may define distance from T to any subtree of T:
   ◇ distance from T to itself is 0
   ◇ distance from T to child of T is 1
   ◇ distance from T to child of a child of T is 2, etc.
• given tree T, for non-empty nodes q in T we define
   ◇ Depth(q): distance from root to q
   ◇ Height(q): maximal distance from q to a leaf
• nodes w/ same depth are said to be at same level


Basic operations
• representation of graphs must allow following operations:
• Get(i,j)
   ◇ checks whether there is an edge from i to j, if so it also returns any extra data
• Put(i,j,x)
   ◇ adds edge from i to j, together with extra data x
   ◇ if edge from i to j exists, may choose to require an error message
• AllFrom(i)
   ◇ returns list of edges with source i


Adjacency Matrix Implementation
• representation choice:
   ◇ Adjacency Matrix where entry at row i and column j specifies whether there is an edge from i to j (and contians any extra data)
   ◇ get runs in time Θ(1)
   ◇ put runs in time Θ(1)
   ◇ AllFrom runs in time Θ(n) (even in best case
• adjacency list
   ◇ to each i associates a list of nodes j (w/ extra data) s.t. there is an edge from i to j
   ◇ Get(i, _) runs in time Θ(n)
      ▪ in worst case where i has many neighbors
   ◇ Put runs in time Θ(1)
      ▪ Θ(n) if check for duplicates
   ◇ AllFrom runs in time Θ(1)
      ▪ simply return list at j
• Trade-offs
   ◇ Drawback of adjacency lists:
      ▪ occurs if graph is dense
         - Get will be Θ(n)
   ◇ drawback of adjacency matrix
      ▪ occurs if graph is sparse</rich_text>

Priority Queues
• A priority queue
   ◇ is a collection of records with keys
   ◇ allows following operations:
      ▪ insert: a record is added to the collection
      ▪ FindMax: record with highest key is returned
      ▪ DeleteMax: record with highest key is deleted from collection


Priority Queues by Arrays
• if implemented by unsorted array:
   ◇ Insert ∈ Θ(1)
   ◇ Find/DeleteMax
• if implemented by sorted array:
   ◇ Find/DeleteMax ∈ Θ(1)
   ◇ Insert ∈ Θ(n)
• need better option, with all operations sub-linear


The Heap Property
• A heap is a rooted tree that satisfies the heap property:
   ◇ if q is a child of p then K(p) &gt;= K(q)
• Thus parents have key sat least as big as their children
   ◇ sometimes we want the </rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">dual</rich_text>
			<rich_text> property instead
   ◇ don't confuse with garbage-collected memory (Java)


Heap Property Maintenance: Sift Down
• Heap property may be violated if the key of a node n decreases
   ◇ then have to “sift down” n
• Sift Down:
   ◇ while n has child with bigger key
      ▪ swap n and child with biggest key
• worst case running time in Θ(h) with h as the tree height


Heap Property Maintenance: Percolate Up
• Heap property may be violated if the key of a node n increases
   ◇ have to “percolate” n
• Percolate Up:
   ◇ while n has parent with smaller key:
      ▪ swap n and parent
• Worst case running time in Θ(h) with h as tree height


Priority Queues by Heaps
• with heap implementation:
   ◇ FindMax: just take root, this is Θ(1)
   ◇ Insert:
      ▪ insert new node as a leaf
      ▪ percolate leaf up
      ▪ This is in Θ(h)
   ◇ DeleteMax:
      ▪ move one leaf to the root


Representation of Heaps
• use rooted trees that are binary and
   ◇ essentially complete
      ▪ balanced, except that some rightmost leaves may be missing
• can use an array A to represent an essentially complete binary tree
   ◇ if it has k elements then A[1..k] are used
      ▪ A[1] is root
      ▪ A[2] and A[3] are left and right children of root,
      ▪ A[4..7] grandchildren of root, etc
   ◇ in general, can easily compute:
      ▪ Parent(i) = [i/2]
      ▪ leftchild(i) = 2i
      ▪ rightchild(i) = 2i + 1


Converting a Tree into a Heap
• given an essentiall complete binary tree we want to:
   ◇ convert it into a heap
   ◇ use node-swapping only
• Method:
   ◇ for each node
      ▪ recursively convert children into heaps
      ▪ sift down the node
   ◇ can be implemented bottom-up by processing the array downwards:
      ▪ </rich_text>

			<rich_text>


Cost of Heap Conversion, Attempt 1
• recall method for each node
   ◇ cost: sum(i = 1 -&gt; n) { O(height(i)) }
   ◇ crude approximation: n lg(n)
   ◇ tentative recurrence: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + lg(n)
      ▪ has solution T(n) ∈ Θ(lg(n))
      ▪ one subtree may be larger than the other, so not as accurate


Heap Sort
• Given array A[1..n] to be sorted we
   ◇ convert to heap
   ◇ let i traverse from n down to 1 while maintaining invariant
      ▪ A[i+1..n] consists of th en-i largest elements, in non-decreasing order
      ▪ A[1..i] has the heap property
      ▪ can be done as follows:
         - exchange A[1] and A[i]
         - sift down A[1] in tree A[1..i-1]

Complexity of Heap Sort
• Recall that to sort an array of n elements, we
   ◇ convert to heap, in time Θ(n)
   ◇ for i from n down to 1:
      ▪ exchange A[1] and A[i], in time Θ(1)
      ▪ Sift down A[1] in heap A[1..i] in time Θ(lg(i))
   ◇ contributes sum(i=1 to n) {lg(i)}
      ▪ which we know is in Θ(n lg(n))
• thus heap sort has
   ◇ time complexity in Θ(n lg(n)) which improves insertion sort
   ◇ space complexity in Θ(1), i.e. in place
      ▪ improves merge-sort
